# Udemy Course - Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3
Created this project while working on Udemy Course - Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3.

This contains two sub-projects
* The Dummy Blogpost - To learn basic HTML and CSS and Organization of Front-end Projects - See [Live Demo Here](https://aashishnagpal.github.io/udemy-learn-build-responsive-websites/blogpost/)
* The Omnifood Project - A Single Page Application (SPA) for a Food Delivery Mobile App, designed from scratch
  
  **I tried to add my own flair in the Omnifood Project with slight modifications or slight different approaches to get similar but desired effect with the design - See [Live Demo Here](https://aashishnagpal.github.io/udemy-learn-build-responsive-websites/omnifood/)**
